    <li> Find out whether you are in Group A or B by consulting the list below.
    <li> Download Scenario A or B depending on your group from the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18P2PwiJ5iH_3_md11L660ygQV_pW_0dY?usp=sharing">Google Drive link</a> or the OneDrive link. 
    <li> Open sidequest, and go to "Currently Installed Apps" and delete "com.DefaultCompany.VRTEST" if it exists.

    <li> Go to "Currently Installed Apps" and press the cog icon next to "com.DefaultCompany.VRTEST", and launch to play the game on your oculus.
    <li> The game starts 10 seconds after you launch. You can use that time to get accustomed to the environment.
    <li> You can only use your Right Hand controller. Depending on your scenario, you can either press 'A' to pick the ball or hold 'A' to keep it picked up. While you have the ball, press the Trigger button to shoot the ball. Instructions are shown on screen.
    <li> You'll have 10 rounds in the tutorial section where the score is not tracked.
    <li> The main game itself is 20 rounds.
